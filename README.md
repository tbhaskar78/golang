# golang_experiments
my experiments with golang
[learning basics of go](learn)

My attempt is to write as many data structs as I can with golang and in turn learn about it. 

1. [stacks](datastruct/stacks)
   * [stack implementation based on array](datastruct/stacks/stkarray.go)
   * [stack implementation based on linked list](datastruct/stacks/stllist.go)
2. [queue](datastruct/queue)
   * [queue implementation based on array](datastruct/queue/qarray.go)
   * [queue implementation based on linked list](datastruct/queue/qllist.go)
3. [Trees](datastruct/trees)
   * [Binary Search Tree](datastruct/trees/bst.go)
